# MedMNIST-NPY-to-JPG-or-PNG
Researchers at Shanghai Jiaotong University created a new open medical image data set MedMNIST and designed the "MedMNIST Classification Decathlon" to promote the research of AutoML algorithms in the field of medical image analysis. But their data set is in Npy file format. I help you to extract npy into png, jpg and other file formats, which can facilitate the experimentation of researchers.
